      <description>While statistics is an exact science, emotions by contrast are subjective, often irrational and difficult to measure. Despite or perhaps even due to this contrast, statistics and emotions are increasingly considered together: if moods and feelings increasingly define what is true and false, what exactly is the role of statistics?
 Are decisions too often made on a purely emotional basis, neglecting statistical data and proven facts?
 How important are evidence-based decision processes given that factual correctness is becoming less and less relevant in politics and the economy?</description>

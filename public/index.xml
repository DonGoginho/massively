      <description>Have you ever wondered in which areas of the canton of Zurich the population is the youngest? Or where the density of employees in a certain industry is the highest? How many people live and work in your neighbourhood? The spatial statistics layers in the cantonal GIS-Browser bear the answers.
Soon, they will be made available as open data via API. As a premiere, for the occasion of the TWIST-Hackdays, preview datasets are made available!</description>

      <description>Geocoding and reverse geocoding Addresses represent an important reference dataset for data analyses. In the GIS domain addresses are the essential basis for customer- and business analyses. Addresses are also pervasive on the web. When we search for directions on google maps we use addresses: behind the scene, these addresses are converted to geographic coordinates, which are then used for the routing analysis. Now the other way around. When we click on a street in google maps we get a tooltip showing the address information of that location: behind the scene, geographic coordinates are converted to addresses.</description>

      <description>While we strive to publish as many interesting new open data for TWIST as possible, it is worth taking a look at already existing open data. In this post we would like to give you a brief outlook over the crowdsourced open data from the application «Züri wie neu». There might still be some hidden, so far undiscovered, truths to be found in it.
The application and derived open data «Züri wie neu» is an online platform of the Zurich city administration in order to facilitate the reporting of damaged infrastructure by citizens.</description>

      <title>Three steps from data desert to a thriving data ecosystem</title>

      <description>Isolated data is information dryland. Data needs to be rooted in its context to blossom and if we want it to thrive, data needs to live in a networked ecosystem.
First step: Let the data sprout For data to sprout, it has to be available to everyone to access, use and share. At TWIST2018 we work with Open Data. And we want to work with you, to find innovative ways to analyse, visualise and combine data.</description>

      <description>We are currently collecting ideas and compiling a list of exciting data sets to be used at the Twist-Hackdays. There will be no prescribed challenges. We will provide a pool of ideas which will serve as a source of inspiration and a solid starting point for potential Hackday-projects. We do our best to make until yet undisclosed data sources open soon, which could be used for the first time at the TWIST-Hackdays.</description>

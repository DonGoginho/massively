We are commited to make new open data sources available soon, which could be used for the first time at the TWIST-Hackdays. Below you can find an overview over the not yet published datasets, which will - hopefully - be open by then.
Also, we're gathering ideas for potential projects as well as already existing interesting open data sources. This page will be updated on a regularly basis over the next few weeks.

### Drafts of potential hackathon-projects

**Linked Open Data** : which "hidden truths" can be made visible when open data can be linked and joined toghether easily? Datasources: Wikidata, Stadt Zürich, Swisstopo.

**OpenSpending** : What is taxpayers' money spent for? Which claims around public spending generally considered valid are facts, which are myths? Datasources: municipal audit commission - API, City of Zurich/ Municipal Finance Portrait, Canton of Zurich

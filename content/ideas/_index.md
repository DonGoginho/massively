We are commited to make new open data sources available soon, which could be used for the first time at the TWIST-Hackdays. Below you can find an overview on the not yet published datasets, which will hopefully be available by then.

### In Evaluation:

- Data on weekly case numbers (national level) of infectious diseases, tick-borne diseases, influenza-like diseases
  
- Detailed data on all the registered motorvehicles since 2012, Canton Zurich

- Detailled passenger-counts of selected tram stations, City of Zurich

- OpenPolitics: parliamentary business api, City of Zurich

- Members of the cantonal parliament since 1910

- Spatial raster data on population, employees and buildings

- Geodata of building outlines with building age, Canton of Zurich

- Data on real-estate transactions, Canton of Zurich

### Potential hackathon-projects

We're also gathering ideas for projects as well as already existing interesting open data sources:

- Linked Open Data with different datasources (Wikidata, Stadt Zürich, swisstopo)

- OpenSpending: Rechnungsprüfungskommissions-API, Stadt Zürich / Gemeindefinanzporträt ZH

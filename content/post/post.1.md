As part of the 2018 Swiss Statistics Meeting, a hackathon will be held for the first time. During the 
hackathon, interested participants will research the potential of various data sets. Between 50 and 
100 participants are expected who will work together in 4 to 5 teams. Following the launch on Wednesday 22 August at which data will be presented and specifics discussed, attendees will explore 
the data in depth and will work in interdisciplinary teams. The different skills and backgrounds within 
each team will allow for creativity and the development of new solutions and ideas.
